# FRC R
Playing around with R to look at some FRC data, using the The Blue Alliance API.

I've been using the book R for Data Science to learn R, which is available online for free at http://r4ds.had.co.nz/

## TBA API

The file `get_tba_data.R` has a few helper methods to access data from The Blue Alliance API. You can see its usage in the .Rmd notebooks here.

## Analysis

Here are a few of the analyses I've done with this:
* [2018 Week Two Match Analysis](https://github.com/gregmarra/frc-r/blob/master/2018_tba_w2_blog_post.md)
* [2018 Team Growth](https://github.com/gregmarra/frc-r/blob/master/2018_teams.md)

Here are fast examples of plots this makes easy:
